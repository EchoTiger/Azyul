#region Summary and Documentation
//
// QUICK DOX:
// INTERACTWITH interacts with mobs or objects in various fashions, including:
//  * Gossiping with the mob through a set of dialogs
//  * "Right-clicking" on the mob to complete a goal
//  * Buying particular items off of vendors
//  * Using an item on a mob or object.  The item can be one-click use, or two-click
//      use (two-click: clicks once to get a 'placement cursor', and clicks the
//      second time to drop the placement cursor on the mob or object).
//  * Looting or harvesting (through interaction) an item off a mob or object
// The behavior initiates interaction by "right clicking" on the mob of interest.
// The subsequent actions taken by the behavior depend on the attributes provided.
//
// BEHAVIOR ATTRIBUTES:
// *** ALSO see the documentation in QuestBehaviorBase.cs.  All of the attributes it provides
// *** are available here, also.  The documentation on the attributes QuestBehaviorBase provides
// *** is _not_ repeated here, to prevent documentation inconsistencies.
//
// Basic Attributes:
//      FactionIdN [at least one is REQUIRED: FactionIdN, MobIdN, MobIdIncludesSelf]
//          Identifies the faction of the mobs on which the interaction should take place.
//          If you specify both MobIdN and FactionIdN, the two sets will be combined,
//          and any target that fulfillseither MobIdN or FactionIdN will be selected for interaction.
//      MobIdN [at least one is REQUIRED: FactionIdN, MobIdN, MobIdIncludesSelf]
//          Identifies the mobs on which the interaction should take place.
//          The MobIdN can represent either an NPC (WoWUnit) or an Object (WoWObject).
//          The two types can freely be mixed.
//          If you specify both MobIdN and FactionIdN, the two sets will be combined,
//          and any target that fulfillseither MobIdN or FactionIdN will be selected for interaction.
//      MobIdIncludesSelf [Default: false; at least one is REQUIRED: FactionIdN, MobIdN, MobIdIncludesSelf]
//          Indentifies 'self' as one of the mobs on which the interaction should take place.
//          If you specify other qualifiers, such as required auras, missing auras, mob state,
//          not moving, etc, 'self' must meet the qualifers just like any other mob.
//      NumOfTimes [optional; Default: 1]
//          This is the number of times the behavior should interact with MobIdN.
//          Once this value is achieved, the behavior considers itself done.
//          If the Quest or QuestObjectiveIndex completes prior to reaching this
//          count, the behavior also terminates.
//
// Optional Target Qualifiers (applies to all targets, including 'self'):
// These attributes further qualify a target that fullfills the MobIdN/FactionIdN/Self selection.
//      AuraIdOnMobN [optional; Default: none]
//          The target *must* possess an aura that matches one of the defined 
//          AuraIdMissingFromMobN, in order to be considered a target for interaction.
//      AuraIdMissingFromMob [optional; Default: none]
//          The target must *not* possess an aura that matches one of the defined 
//          AuraIdMissingFromMobN, in order to be considered a target for interaction.
//      MobHpPercentLeft [optional; Default: 100.0]
//          The target's health must be at or below this value to be considered a qualfiied target.
//          This value is only considered if MobState is "BelowHp".
//      MobState [optional; Default: DontCare]
//          [Allowed values for NPC targets: Alive, AliveNotInCombat, BelowHp, Dead, DontCare]
//          This attribute qualifies the state the MobIdN or FactionIdN must be in,
//          when selecting targets for interaction.
//      NotMoving [optional; Default: false]
//          If true, the behavior will only consider targets that are not moving.
//
// Interaction by Buying Items:
//      BuyItemCount [optional; Default: 1]
//          This is the number of items (specified by BuyItemId) that should be
//          purchased from the Vendor (specified by MobId).
//      InteractByBuyingItemId [optional; Default: none]
//          This is the ItemId of the item that should be purchased from the
//          Vendor (specified by MobId).
//
// Interact by Casting Spell:
//      InteractByCastingSpellId [optional; Default: none]
//          Specifies an SpellId to use on the specified target.
//          The spell may be a normal 'one-click-to-use' spell, or it may be
//          a (two-click) spell that needs to be placed on the ground at
//          the target's location.
//
// Interaction by Gossiping:
//      InteractByGossipOptions [optional; Default: none]
//          Defines a comma-separated list of (1-based) numbers that specifies
//          which Gossip option to select in each dialog frame when chatting with an NPC.
//          This value should be separated with commas. ie. InteractByGossipOptions="1,1,4,2".
//
// Interaction by Looting:
//      InteractByLooting [optional; Default: false]
//          If true, the behavior will pick up loot from any loot frame
//          offered by the MobIdN.
//          This feature is largely unused since the WoW game mechanics
//          have changed.
//
// Interaction by Quest frames:
//      InteractByQuestFrameDisposition [optional; Default: TerminateProfile]
//          [Allowed values: Accept/Complete/Continue/Ignore/TerminateBehavior/TerminateProfile]
//          This attribute determines the behavior's response should the NPC
//          with which we've interacted offer us a quest frame.
//          Accept/Complete/Continue
//              clicks on the appropriate button in the offered quest frame.
//              The behavior continues after the appropriate button is clicked.
//          Ignore
//              closes the offered quest frame, and continues with the behavior.
//          TerminateBehavior
//              closes the offered quest frame, and terminates the behavior.
//              This is useful in situations where the Quest frame was unexpected,
//              but tells us what 'state' an NPC may be in.  See the "By Any Means Necessary"
//              in the Examples section below.
//
// Interact by Using Item:
//      InteractByUsingItemId [optional; Default: none]
//          Specifies an ItemId to use on the specified MobInN.
//          The item may be a normal 'one-click-to-use' item, or it may be
//          a (two-click) item that needs to be placed on the ground at
//          the MobIdN's location.
//
// Tunables:
//      CollectionDistance [optional; Default: 100.0]
//          Measured from the toon's current location, this value specifies
//          the maximum distance that should be searched when looking for
//          a viable MobId with which to interact.
//      IgnoreCombat [optional; Default: false]
//          If true, this behavior will not defend itself if attacked, and
//          will carry on with its main task.
//      IgnoreLoSToTarget [optional; Default: false]
//          If true, the behavior will not consider Line of Sight when trying to interact
//          with the selected target.
//      KeepTargetSelected [optional; Default: false]
//          If true, the behavior will not clear the toon's target after the interaction
//          is complete.  Instead, the target will remain on the last interacted
//          mob until a new mob is ready for interaction.
//          If false, the behavior clears the toon's target immediately after
//          it considers the interaction complete.
//      MinRange [optional; Default: 0.0]
//          Defines the minimum range at which the interaction with MobIdN should take place.
//          If the toon is too close to the mob, the toon will move to acquire this minimum
//          distance to the mob.
//      PreInteractMountStrategy [optional; Default: None]
//          [allowed values: CancelShapeshift, Dismount, DismountOrCancelShapeshift, Mount, None]
//          Provides the opportunity to alter the mounting state of a toon immediately prior
//          to interacting, or using an object.  The options are defined as follows:
//              CancelShapeshift
//                  Cancels *any* shapeshifted form, whether it represents a 'mounted form'
//                  or not.  Examples of non-mounted forms include a Druid's Bear or Cat Form.
//              Dismount
//                  Unmounts from an explicit mount, or cancels a 'mounted form'.  Examples
//                  of mounted forms are Druid Flight Forms, Druid Travel Form, Shaman Ghost Wolf,
//                  and Worgen Running Wild.
//              DismountOrCancelShapeshift
//                  Dismounts or cancel's a shapeshifted form--whichever is appropriate.
//              Mount
//                  Mounts the mount defined in the user's preference settings.
//              None
//                  Does not alter the existing mounting state prior to interaction.
//      ProactiveCombatStrategy [optional; Default: ClearAll]
//          [allowed values: NoClear/ClearMobsTargetingUs/ClearMobsThatWillAggro/ClearAll]
//              NoClear
//                  Will not proactively clear around the selected target.  This means that
//                  an attempt to interact with the target could be interrupted by a mob.
//              ClearMobsTargetingUs
//                  If a mob targets us we immediately move to engage it, rather than wait
//                  for the mob to actually close the range to us, put us in combat, then
//                  we deal with it.  This option prevents dragging a large number of mobs
//                  to our selected interact target only to have to fight them.
//              ClearMobsThatWillAggro
//                  If mobs within 'aggro range' of our selected interact target are cleared
//                  before we attempt to interact with the selected target.  This prevents us
//                  from being interrupted when we attempt to interact with our selected target.
//              ClearAll
//                  Combines ClearMobsThatWillAggro and ClearMobsTargetingUs.
//      Range [optional; Default: 4.0]
//          Defines the maximum range at which the interaction with MobIdN should take place.
//          If the toon is out of range, the toon will be moved within this distance
//          of the mob.
//      WaitForNpcs [optional; Default: true]
//          This value affects what happens if there are no MobIds in the immediate area.
//          If true, the behavior will move to the next hunting ground waypoint, or if there
//          is only one waypoint, the behavior will stand and wait for MobIdN to respawn.
//          If false, and the behavior cannot locate MobIdN in the immediate area, the behavior
//          considers itself complete.
//          Please see "Things to know", below.
//      WaitTime [optional; Default: 0ms]
//          Defines the number of milliseconds to wait after the interaction is successfully
//          conducted before carrying on with the behavior on other mobs.
//      X/Y/Z [optional; Default: toon's current location when behavior is started]
//          This specifies the location where the toon should loiter
//          while waiting to interact with MobIdN.  If you need a large hunting ground
//          you should prefer using the <HuntingGrounds> sub-element, as it allows for
//          multiple locations (waypoints) to visit.
//          This value is automatically converted to a <HuntingGrounds> waypoint.
//
// BEHAVIOR EXTENSION ELEMENTS (goes between <CustomBehavior ...> and </CustomBehavior> tags)
// See the "Examples" section for typical usage.
//      HuntingGrounds [optional; Default: none]
//          The HuntingGrounds contains a set of Waypoints we will visit to seek mobs
//          that fulfill the quest goal.  The <HuntingGrounds> element accepts the following
//          attributes:
//              WaypointVisitStrategy= [optional; Default: Random]
//              [Allowed values: InOrder, Random]
//              Determines the strategy that should be employed to visit each waypoint.
//              Any mobs encountered while traveling between waypoints will be considered
//              viable.  The Random strategy is highly recommended unless there is a compelling
//              reason to otherwise.  The Random strategy 'spread the toons out', if
//              multiple bos are running the same quest.
//          Each Waypoint is provided by a <Hotspot ... /> element with the following
//          attributes:
//              Name [optional; Default: ""]
//                  The name of the waypoint is presented to the user as it is visited.
//                  This can be useful for debugging purposes, and for making minor adjustments
//                  (you know which waypoint to be fiddling with).
//              X/Y/Z [REQUIRED; Default: none]
//                  The world coordinates of the waypoint.
//              Radius [optional; Default: 7.0]
//                  Once the toon gets within Radius of the waypoint, the next waypoint
//                  will be sought.
//
// THiNGS TO KNOW:
// * As a design choice, this behavior waits a variant amount of time when 'clicking on things'.
//      We try to simulate an attentive human as much as possible.
//
// * The InteractByGossipOptions and InteractByBuyingItemId attributes can be combined to get to
//      Innkeeper goods.  Innkeepers require you to select one of their gossip options before they
//      will show you their wares for sale.
//
// * If the InteractByGossipOptions selects a "bind to this location" option, then InteractWith
//      will automatically confirm the request to bind at the location.  After the binding is complete
//      InteractWith displays a confirmation message of the new bind location.
//
// * If you specify MobState="Dead", but only alive mobs exist in the area, InteractWith
//      will kill the alive mobs, and then try to interact with them once they are dead.
//
// * The behavior pro-actively clears mobs within aggro range of the selected interact target.
//      This prevents the mobs from interfering with the interaction.  If IgnoreCombat="true",
//      then this pro-active clearing is also turned off.
//
// * If you are trying to gossip with NPCs that are in combat, this behavior will help the NPC
//      kill the mob so the NPC will leave combat.  This is necessary because many NPCs will not
//      gossip when they are in combat.
//
// * Be careful when specifying the WaitForNpcs="false".
//      The 'interact blacklist' is internal to the behavior.  The means the blacklist is destroyed
//      any time the behavior exits, and a fresh one is created upon re-entry to the behavior.
//      This means InteractWith does not know which mobs have already been interacted and which
//      have not, when WaitForNpcs="true".  The can cause slow progress as the failure detection
//      mechnaisms built into the behavior kick in and re-exclude non-viable mobs as they are
//      rediscovered.
//
// * Deprecated attributes:
//      + BuySlot
//          This attribute is deprecated, and BuySlot presents a number of problems.
//          If a vendor presents 'seasonal' or limited-quantity wares, the slot number
//          for the desired item can change.
//          OLD DOX: Buys the item from the slot. Slots are:    0 1
//                                                              2 3
//                                                              4 5
//                                                              6 7
//                                                              page2
//                                                              8 9 etc.
//      + ObjectType
//          This option should no longer be specified--the behavior just 'figures it out'
//      + Nav--prefer MovementBy, instead.
//          For support reasons, here is the old documentation:
//              Nav [optional; Default: not any]
//              [Allowed values: CTM, Mesh, None]
//              This attribute is no longer used--use MovementBy, instead.
//              (See documentation in QuestBehaviorBase for details).

//			X="-8365.76" Y="594.658" Z="97.00068" />

//
//
// QUEST EXAMPLES:  
// "By Any Means Necessary" (http://wowhead.com/quest=9978)
// This is a difficult quest for a number of reasons. First, a bug in the WoWclient indicates the quest
// is always completed, whether it is or not.  Thus we can not use an "IsCompleted" test to make decisions.
// Because of this bug, we cannot associate a QuestId attribute with our invocation of InteractWith.
// Second, Empoor may be in one of two states.  In one state, he'll offer us a gossip frame, and we must gossip
// and finish the ensuing fight before we can turn in the quest.  In the other state, he allows us to turn in
// the quest immediately (this happens when someone else has just fought him, and he stays in the second state
// for a while).
// To solve the problem, we arrange for InteractWith to gossip with the NPC.  If he offers the Quest frame,
// we terminate the 'gossip' behavior (via providing the InteractByQuestFrameDisposition="TerminateBehavior"
// attribute.
//      <!-- A couple of states for Empoor:
//      	1. We may need to gossip, do the fight, then turn in quest
//  	   	2. Someone else may have started and finished the fight already, and we can
//      		turn in quest immediately.
//      	NB: The WoWclient makes this quest appears complete, even though its not.
//      	So, we can't use the "IsQuestCompleted()" qualifier as a valid check.
